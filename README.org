* A tool for managing Mullvad wireguard
** About
Focused on providing high-level
Most commands require running as root
Only tested on Linux, but probably works on other Unix-likes
** Functions
*** Rotate
Brings down the current tunnel, choose a new different config and brings it up
*** Up and Down
Wraps wg-quick, so the same as that
*** Is_up
Checks if a wireguard connection is active
*** Filter_vpn | Check vpn perf
Filters out vpn's by various connection metrics
Used to provide a baseline perf for partially random get_random_config
*** Get_random_config
Does exactly what it says with one exception
When 'fully_rand' parameter is set to 'False', it chooses randomly from vpns filtered for a baseline perf
* Current Status
It Works, but that's it
I'd like to add a few things to get it to what I consider good
- [ ] Way to make running cmds with root less annoying
- [ ] See if there are lower level cmds then wg-quick I can use
- [ ] Add function to get all wireguard configs with just an account number
- [ ] Write a service script that runs 'rotate' at set time intervals
- [ ] Test with mypy and write a few tests for the bigger functions
- [ ] Implement caching for some of the functions that pull remote data
- [ ] Reimplement cli interface with pre-existing library
  I just need to find one I actually like
  
Once those are all finished and a final polish, I'll add it to pypi.
